:::caution[Assumptions]
The guide will assume you are using docker, with example commands that are either one liners or from within the container.
:::

:::danger
Don't run this directly on the host system unless you know what you are doing. It's not recommended and the build will probably fail.

<Details summary="What to expect">![](/qbittorrent-nox-static/docs_images/script_usage/first-run.png)</Details>

‚≠ê When you are familiar with the script you can do most builds you want with a one liner. It's pretty simple to use.

### Execute the script

```bash
./qbittorrent-nox-static.sh
```

:::note
Please see the [switches and flags summary](./build-help?id=switches-and-flags-summarised) to see what options you can pass and how to use them
:::

The first thing you should do is to run the script with the `-h` flag to see the help output and the script defaults.

```bash
./qbittorrent-nox-static.sh -h
```

By passing `all` as the first argument, you can build everything based on the default settings.

```bash
./qbittorrent-nox-static.sh all
```

For example, to use `ICU` using `-i`, optimise for the host system CPU using `-o`, `-s` to strip the binary and build using libtorrent v1.2.19

```bash
./qbittorrent-nox-static.sh all -i -o -s -lt v1.2.19
```

Same as previous command but using `env` settings

```bash
qbt_libtorrent_tag="v1.2.19" qbt_skip_icu="yes" qbt_optimise_strip="yes" qbt_optimize="-march=native" ./qbittorrent-nox-static.sh all
```
