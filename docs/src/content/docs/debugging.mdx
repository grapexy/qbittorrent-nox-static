To properly debug a segfault the build will need to have been built with libtorrent and qbitorrent debug symbols.

One of the issues here is that with the static build the libtorrent debug symbols can add 100MB to the file size.

This can be done using the `-d` flag or `export qbt_build_debug=on`.

The easiest way to get this is to fork the repo - https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/fork

Then use the `matrix_multi_build_and_release_qbt_workflow_files_debug.yml` via the actions section of your fork and it will build the debug version for you and upload it to the releases section of your fork.

Then you can download the debug version and use it to debug the segfault.
