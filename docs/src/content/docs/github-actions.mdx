This project relies heavily on Github Actions to build and release the binaries. The actions are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

:::note
The jobs can be viewed here: [https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/actions](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/actions)

They workflows are located here: [https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/tree/master/.github/workflows](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/tree/master/.github/workflows)

## Github repo Actions settings

The only permissions these actions should need is:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

:::tip
These permissions are required to create the release and upload the binaries to the release.

They are already configured in the workflows and you should not need to configure any forked repos to use these actions.
:::

:::caution
If you want to configure the settings repo wide for some reason you can do so via the settings page of the repo.
:::

These should be the default settings for recently forked versions of this repo that require this permission.

You can find these settings bu going to the repo settings/actions/general
